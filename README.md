This repository is for my science fair project

To use the C# script, you need to first download the .NET SDK version 6.0 or higher.
It should be really simple, just open the installer and if it asks to restart your computer just restart your computer.
Then you will need to type into the terminal: dotnet new console
It should create a C# script and a .csproj file.
Do not worry about the .csproj file, open up the calc.cs file here on Github and copy and paste the code into your own script.

Lua is a pretty complicated process to get working, so here is a video to explain it to you:

I think the video explains the set up process pretty well. 

Node.js and Python are straight forward, they both have an installer for you to use to download the language.

Another note, I don't write many comments because I just don't feel the need to explain what is happening as in my opinion, it is pretty easy to understand, especially in these scripts.
